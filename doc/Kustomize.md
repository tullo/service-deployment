Kustomize is under construction since 2017 and has been introduced as a native kubectl sub-command in the version 1.14.

[kubectl doesnâ€™t have the latest kustomize, when will it be updated?](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/faq/#kubectl-doesnt-have-the-latest-kustomize-when-will-it-be-updated)
This is blocked on either moving kubectl into its own repo, or changing its dependencies. ETA k8s ~1.20.
